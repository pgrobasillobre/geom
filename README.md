## ✨ About

GEOM is a command-line tool designed for managing XYZ geometry files with various operations, including:

- 🏗️ **Nanoparticle geometry creation** (e.g., tips, pyramids)
- 🧪 **Graphene structure generation** (e.g., ribbons, triangles)
- 🔄 **Transformation operations** (translation, rotation)
- 📏 **Distance control** between two geometries
- 🔬 **Minimum distance calculation** between XYZ files
- 🎯 **Geometrical center computation**
- 🛠️ **Geometry merging**
- 🔍 **Specular (mirror) geometry creation**

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python **3.8.10** or later
