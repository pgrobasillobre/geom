#
# CD (Continuous Delivery) to TestPyPI for GEOM.
#
# What it does:
# - When pushed a git tag like v2.0.0rc1, GitHub Actions:
#   1) builds a wheel + sdist into dist/
#   2) publishes them to TestPyPI
#
# Why tags:
# - Tags represent “release points” and are the usual trigger for CD.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - pyproject.toml version must match the tag version (without the leading "v").
#   Example: tag v2.0.0rc1  <->  version = "2.0.0rc1"
