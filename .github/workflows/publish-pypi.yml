# .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml
#
# CD (Continuous Delivery) to REAL PyPI.
#
# Trigger:
# - Push a stable tag like v2.0.1 (NOT v2.0.1rc1)
#
# Safety:
# - tags-ignore prevents accidentally publishing release candidates to PyPI.
#
# Requirement:
# - pyproject.toml version must match the tag (without the leading "v").
