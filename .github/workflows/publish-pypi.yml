# .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml
#
# CD (Continuous Delivery) to REAL PyPI.
#
# Trigger:
# - Push a stable tag like v2.0.1 (NOT v2.0.1rc1)
#
# Safety:
# - We only trigger on tags that look exactly like vX.Y.Z.
#   This avoids publishing release candidates (rc), betas, etc.
#
# Requirement:
# - pyproject.toml version must match the tag version (without the leading "v").
#   Example: tag v2.0.1  <->  version = "2.0.1"
